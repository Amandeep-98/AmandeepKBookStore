DONE WITH FIRST PART AT 4PM.

Coming Thursday, Professor is going to give the second part slides of this Assignment.




Here comes the day to start the secong part of assignment..........


November-10-2021  9AM


I started working on this assignment in afternoon because i have classes and some other work of college. I'm feeling tired but excited to start it.......


Start with the First step!!!!!!!!!!!


I'm going to Build the Project(Part 2) 2.1 Create the DB.

To prepare for the next part,I ‘build’ the application and confirm there are no errors.
And Again i Review appsettings.json.

So, I'm going to Create the migrations (using code-first, where changes are “pushed” to the database), modify the database name and save.



(20211113004943_AddDefaultIdentityMigration)

(20211113012857_AddCategoryToDb)


MIGRATION files are created.........10-11-2021 AT 11:22 AM.




I Used the NuGet Package Manager Console to add the migration.
By mistake, I selected the wrong default project.
And with given instructions I Changed to the correct default project (.DataAccess) and run again.
Here, Added the new migration file name entry in the README.


I Reviewed the file for the SQL-like syntax, statements, columns and primary key constraints.
I Noted tables related the ASP.NET Identity.
The database is updated Now in the PM console.
I'm Going to Review the updated database in the SQL Server Object Explorer.
Here i Checked for errors, run the application.

BREAK 4PM

I'm back again at 5pm.


I Added  a new table to the DB by creating a Category model and push it to the DB Or Added a new class file to the .Models project and modify.

Now, I Added the migration via the PM Console.

I Updated this and note the added using statement
Re-run the add-migration and review the changes to the AddCategoryToDb (resolve the duplication error that will occur).


I Updated the database, confirm the new Categories table via the SQL SOE and push commits to GitHub.

OH NO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! here comes the big red error......
Your target project 'SanjnasBookStore' doesn't match your migrations assembly 'SanjnasBooks.DataAccess'. 
Either change your target project or change your migrations assembly. Change your migrations assembly by using DbContextOptionsBuilder.
E.g. options.UseSqlServer(connection, b => b.MigrationsAssembly("SanjnasBookStore")). By default, the migrations assembly is the assembly containing the DbContext.


So, i fixed it and build my project again. It run successfully.

Its almost 9PM and i'm goind make dinner so will be back at 11pm.

So,i don't have enough energy now to do some work more so i think that's all for the day will meet you soon project.

BYE BYE:)



November-10-2021   1:30PM

Here i'm going to attemt part2 (2.2)Repository------


Build the Project
(Part 2)
2.2 Repository


I'm excited bit nervous about this part as it seems tricky to me.

With first step i'm going to create the Category.cs and adding it to the ApplicationDbContext it’s time to implement the Repository, a generic way of accessing common functionality (e.g. getting a record), in the .DataAccess project.
Add a new folder name it ‘Repository’ (for class implementations of interfaces) and add an IRepository (for the interfaces) folder inside it.
Here, i'm going to Add a new item of type interface to the folder and name it IRepository.cs 
So, Modify so it can be used on the Category class to do all the CRUD operations (note using statements).
Next, step is do the Methods to use for CRUD:
Firstly, Get item from the DB.
Then, List of Categories,Add objects,Remove objects.

So here, I'm going to Implement the class that implements the repository.
I Included the using statement.
Then, View the potential fixes and ‘implement interface’.

I'm going to Modify the code to create the constructors and dependency injection (DI).


Here i Created the individual repos for category and all potential models to be added in the future .
Named----
1.CategoryRepository.cs
2.ICategoryRepository.cs

BREAK TIME AT 3:00 PM.........................



AGAIN GOING TO START AT 4:30PM....................

Again, I Modify CategoryRepository (note the using statements and the message for formal parameters – review in Repository.cs the method pointing to the ApplicationDBContext).

So, IModify ICategoryRepository interface

Review and modify the error now in CategoryRepository.cs (implement the interface to update)
Complete the remaining modifications (note the comments)

Build, fix any error and push commits to GitHub


Implement a stored procedure repository and map multiple repositories in a Unit of Work

Add a new interface in the IRepository folder - ISP_Call.cs – that extends IDisposable
Include the methods shown (note the comments) and install the NuGet package for Dapper

Now implement this with a new class in the Repository folder.


Add a new class (SP_Call.cs) in the Repository folder, select the appropriate using statement and implement the ISP_Call interface

Add a connection to the database, note the additional using statements
Update the implementation of the ISP_Call interface

Now add the wrapper for Unit of Work.

BREAK AT 8:00PM........................



GOING TO START AT 10:00PM...........


Here I Add a new interface (IUnitOfWork) to the IRepository folder and update the code.

Now implement this inside the UnitOfWork (Hint: Add a class)
Modify the code (make sure the public class implements the interface -  UnitOfWork : IUnitOfWork)

To make it accessible by the project, register it Startup.cs in the ConfigureServices method (don’t forget the using statements)

Build and correct any errors, push commits to GitHub.

With the addition of UnitOfWork in Startup.cs, it will be accessible with DI by any Controller.
Close all currently opened tabs.
Add a new MVC Controller Empty inside Areas/Admin.
Named it CategoryController.cs.
Modify the code to use the IUnitOfWork from the .DataAccess project and the IRepository folder With using statement.
Add a new folder in the Areas/View with the same name as the Controller.
Add a new ‘Index’ view to the folder (note the template) and modify with the generic.


BREAK TIME 12:30Am


HTML code from the Category Index View.txt file found in the Assignment 2 - Files folder. 

SO BIG ERROR CAME TO MY WAY :(

Again i cleard it then i Saved and run the application.
In _Layout.cshtml, move the ‘Category’ link to the Content Management drop-down. 
Review the changes to the navigation.


BREAK TIME 2:30AM

I JUST WANT to complete this project asap with following each and every step.
As i have php assignment due by tommorow its lenghty tooooo...... No matter what Or what time i complete the assignment evemn in the morning but i will do itttttttttttttttttt.........


BACK AT 3:30AM

Error cam my way but will do it.....

Modify the Index.cshtml to add the icons in the Category section from Font Awesome and confirm and Delete it and add the JavaScript from the Assignment 2 files folder in to the wwwroot/js folder (note the ‘div’ is now in the return portion of the category.js file.
In Index.cshtml add the @section call to the category.js script and run the project.


At November-13-2021 i did it mean i completed it and for now i have no energy to do more work ill push it to the github by tommorrow morning...............



Till THEN BYE ;)
